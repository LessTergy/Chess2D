# Chess2D

Classic chess for two players.
This project serves as proof of my Unity Developer skills.
This was a test assignment when applying for a job. The conditions were not to use third-party frameworks and libraries, to use UI.

# Game features
- All types of chess piece can move according to the rules.
- Castling.
- En passant.
- Pawn promotion.
- Cancel player move if his king is in check.
- You can change start arrangement of pieces for test specific cases.

# Unrealized features
- If the king is in a checkmate position, the message "game over" does not pop up.
